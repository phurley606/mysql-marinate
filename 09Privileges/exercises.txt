Exercises for chapter 9

1) What’s the difference between a local and a remote user?

2) When would you grant only read access to a user?

3) Write a GRANT statement to create a user, rowena, who has privileges to execute 
SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT statements on the contacts and appointment databases. 
The user should be allowed to access the server from machines in the domain invyhome.com.

4) Write a GRANT statement that modifies the privileges of the user rowena created in 
Question 3. Add privileges to SELECT from the customer table in the sales database, and to 
SELECT the debtor column from the invoice table in the accounts database.

5) Three GRANT statements have been issued on your MySQL server:

 GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'hugh'@'hugh.invyhome.com';
 GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON *.* TO 'hugh'@'*.invyhome.com';
 GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO ''@'localhost';

 For each of the following attempts to connect to the server, state whether the connection is allowed and, if so, which user the client is connected as. Assume all connections are attempted from localhost:

     a) mysql --user=hugh --host=localhost

     b) mysql --user=fred

     c) mysql

6) You’ve been employed to evaluate the security of a MySQL installation. Assuming that you’re 
already satisfied with the security configuration from the physical and operating system 
perspective, list four things that you’d check about the MySQL server. For each item, explain 
why you would check it and what you would expect the outcome to be.

7) You’ve recently installed a wireless access point for visitors to your office and configured 
it so that machines that connect through it have IP addresses in the range 192.168.1.1 to 
192.168.1.254. You’ve decided you want users who connect to your MySQL server from those IP 
addresses to have only the SELECT privilege on the contacts database. What steps do you take 
in your MySQL privilege tables to set this up?
