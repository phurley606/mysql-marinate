All exercises here concern the music database, which is available at

I strongly recommend ANSI join style as per 
http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-joins-on-vs-using-vs-theta-style - 
the nutshell is that Theta style is like this:

SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 
WHERE field1=field2 AND filter=something;

ANSI style is like this:
SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON (field1=field2) 
WHERE filter=something;

The reason for this is that when you have many tables joined 
it's easier to see the join clause in ON or USING with ANSI style. 
If you join many tables and use theta style, where everything is 
in the WHERE clause, it's possible to forget some of the join clauses 
in the WHERE. If you put the join clauses in the JOIN part, it's way more readable.


1) Use one or more SELECT statements to find out how many tracks are on New Order's Brotherhood album.


mysql> select count(*) from track
    -> inner join album using (artist_id,album_id)
    -> inner join artist on (album.artist_id = artist.artist_id)
    -> where artist_name = 'New Order' and album_name = 'Brotherhood';
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|       10 |
+----------+



2) Using a join, list the albums that we own by the band New Order

<<<<<<< HEAD

select album_name from album inner join artist using (artist_id) 
where artist_name = 'New Order' order by album_name;

+------------------------------------------+
| album_name                               |
+------------------------------------------+
| Brotherhood                              |
| Power, Corruption & Lies                 |
| Retro - John McCready FAN                |
| Retro - Miranda Sawyer POP               |
| Retro - New Order / Bobby Gillespie LIVE |
| Substance (Disc 2)                       |
| Substance 1987 (Disc 1)                  |
+------------------------------------------+



3) With INSERT statements, add the artist Leftfield to the database. For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has
the following tracks:

The answer to this question should be the INSERT statement(s).

4) How long in minutes is the Leftism album you added in Question 3? Hint: use the
SUM() aggregate function.

select sum(time) from track                                                              
inner join album using (artist_id,album_id)                                            
inner join artist on (album.artist_id = artist.artist_id)                              
where artist_name = 'Leftfield' and album_name = 'Leftism';

+-----------+
| sum(time) |
+-----------+
|     67.99 |
+-----------+



5) Change the time for the Original track on the Leftism album to 6.22.

<<<<<<< HEAD
update track set time = 6.22 where track_name = 'Original' and artist_id = 7 and album_id = 1;



6) Remove the 'Bonus Track' from the Leftism album

delete from track where track_name = 'Bonus Track' and artist_id = 7 and album_id = 1;
