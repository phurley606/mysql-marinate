Chapter 6 Homework

All exercises here concern the music database. 

1. You’ve decided to store more information about artists and albums. Specifically,
for artists, you want to store the names of people who have worked with the artist
(for example, vocalists, guitarists, trumpeters, and drummers), when they began
working with the artist, and when they stopped working with the artist (if they
have done so).

For albums, you want to store the name of the album producer, when the album
was released, and where the album was recorded. Design tables or columns that
can store this information, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of your
design. Choose the column types you need, explaining the advantages and disad-
vantages of your choices.

2. There are five types for storing temporal data: DATETIME, DATE, TIME, YEAR, and
TIMESTAMP. Explain what each is used for, and give an example of a situation in
which you would choose to use it. Note that http://palominodb.com/blog/2011/05/23/datetime-vs-timestamp
has some useful information too.

3. You’ve decided to use the AUTO_INCREMENT feature. List the three requirements that
must be met by the column you’re applying it to.

4. Why can only one column in a table have the AUTO_INCREMENT feature?

5. Using the monitor, create a table with the following statement:
mysql> CREATE TABLE exercise (field1 INT(3));
Using the ALTER TABLE statement, make field1 the primary key, carrying out any
additional steps you need to make this possible. Add a second column, field2, of
type CHAR(64) with a DEFAULT 5 clause. Create an index on a prefix of 10 characters
from field2.
