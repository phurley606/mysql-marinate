1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

The MySQL database server receives and processes requests submitted from separate client programs, e.g. MySQL monitor, MySQL workbench graphical tool, perl code.


2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We'll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> \h select
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
          [HIGH_PRIORITY]
	        [STRAIGHT_JOIN] ....................



3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

Interactive mode: you type individual SQL statements or MySQL commands
Batch mode: you give the monitor a file containing one or more SQL statements and commands to execute


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

They all specify connection information to the MySQL database server
user: MySQL server user name
password: MySQL server password
database: server name or IP address of the host running the MySQL database
